# ir-cues
IR-Cues is an offline incident response playbook tool aiming to give you DFIR commands at your fingertips.
It aims to be A CLI that asks: “What do you want to investigate? (process, registry, network, persistence, browser history)” and then outputs the exact commands (PowerShell, KQL, Velociraptor queries, Sigma rules etc.) basically an interactive playbook.

## Why though?
Have you ever been completing a CTF or BTLO challenge and been digging through a notebook to remember what the command line was to extract the process list from a volatility capture? Have you ever tried to recall how get the parent and child processes on a windows box from a process id but can't find the command to run and you have no recourse to the internet? Well ir-cues is for you. 

ir-cues started life as a tool to fix the fact my memory has slightly more holes than a sieve by giving me a searchable single place where i can go... "what was the powershell to enable powershell remoting?"

Playbooks live in docs, not the terminal.

You need repeatable, short steps and a searchable indexes of commands? well ir-cues prints ready-to-run snippets with brief context.

No agents. No backends. Just text.

Sometimes known as **0xDEADBEEF** (if you frequent BTLO), sometimes known as **Khador Vess** (if you fly internet spaceships), always known as James Long - Security analyst, threat hunter, researcher, trainer and enthusiast. My day job has me teaching dev teams that - yes, SQL injection is still a problem & no, you can't just ignore that expired certificate. Also the answer is yes - i am old enough to remeber the internet where **finger** was still in use. That may or may not be why my memory is so bad.
